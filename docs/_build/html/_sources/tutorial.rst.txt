Tutorial
=============================
The following tutorial illustrates the basic usage of Autosolvate in the command line interface (CLI).

There will be three example systems: naphthalene in water, naphthalene radical in chloroform, naphthalene in acetonitrile

Prerequisites
-------------------------------------------
Once you have AutoSolvate and all dependencies installed you will need the solute xyz file and then you are ready to go! Make sure to give each molecule its own directory to avoid the possibility of overwriting the amber files when running two at a time. The naphthalene neutral and radical coordinates are provided below so that you can follow along on your own computer:

.. note::

  You can download both xyz files here:

  :download:`naphthalene_neutral.xyz <_data/naphthalene_neutral.xyz>`

  :download:`naphthalene_radical.xyz <_data/naphthalene_radical.xyz>`


Now that you have the structures, make a directory for each example. We will start with the neutral molecule. 

Example 1: Naphthalene in Water
-------------------------------------------

Step 1: Solvate system
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The first step is putting the solute in the solvent box, which uses the boxgen command. The documentation shows all of the options for this command, but the only one that is required is specifying the solute xyz file. It will be listed as -m for main. To run boxgen with all of the default settings, use the following command:

``autosolvate boxgen -m naphthalene_neutral.xyz``

Autosolvate will use the default values of water as the solvent, solute charge of 0, solute multiplicity of 1, charge fitting method of resp, box size of 54, and output file name of water_solvated. 

If AutoSolvate is running successfully, the following messages will be printed to your screen::

  AutoSolvate is starting in command line mode!
  Running the module to generate solvent box and force field parameters.

  Finally generate frcmod with parmchk2
  Now create the solute library file
  Generate Amber parameters for the solvated system
  Now add pre-equlibrated solvent box to the solute
  The script has finished successfully

Additionally, you should now have the following files in your directory::

  ANTECHAMBER_AC.AC           ATOMTYPE.INF              nap_neutral.xyz   sqm.in   
  ANTECHAMBER_AC.AC0          leap_add_solventbox.cmd   solute.frcmod     sqm.out  
  ANTECHAMBER_AM1BCC.AC       leap_add_solventbox.log   solute.lib        sqm.pdb  
  ANTECHAMBER_AM1BCC_PRE.AC   leap.cmd                  solute.mol2       water_solvated.inpcrd
  ANTECHAMBER_BOND_TYPE.AC    leap.log                  solute.pdb        water_solvated.pdb
  ANTECHAMBER_BOND_TYPE.AC0   leap_savelib.log          solute.xyz.pdb    water_solvated.prmtop

The three files that we care about for moving forward to the next step are the ones with the output prefix water_solvated (the last three listed above). The ``.inpcrd`` file contains the input coordinates, and the ``.prmtop`` file contains the Amber parameter topology. The ``.pdb`` file has the coordinates for the solute in the solvent box, so you want to check that both the solvent and the solute are there. The block below shows the first few lines of the ``.pdb`` file::

The fourth column has 18 'SLU' entries, or solvent, and under that there are 6 'WAT' entries, which we can see makes up two water molecules. When you visualize ``water_solvated.pdb`` you should be able to see the water box containing the solute:

   :width: 400

With these three files, we are ready to proceed to the next step!

.. note::

   This example uses default settings for boxgen, but these can be changed or simply made explicit by using more flag options. For example, we can change the charge fitting method to bcc, give the output a more specific name, and explicitly define solvent, charge and multiplicity:

   ``autosolvate boxgen -m naphthalene_neutral.xyz -s water -c 0 -u 1 -g "bcc" -o nap_neutral``

   The semi-empirical charge fitting available through Amber performs well for closed-shell systems. However, it is not sufficient for open-shell systems, which will require the use of quantum chemistry charge fitting methods. The methods currently available are bcc fitting in Amber and RESP in Gaussian. RESP is the default setting.


.. _tutstep2:

Step 2: MD Simulation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The second step is running molecular dynamics, which includes equilibration and production time. For this tutorial, we will run a very fast demonstration just to see how the mdrun command works.

To do a short example run of QM/MM use the following command:

``autosolvate mdrun -f water_solvated -q 0 -u 1 -t 300 -p 1 -m 10000 -n 10000 -o 100 -s 100 -l 250 -r``
  
The mdrun command has several more options than the previous one, but the only required options are filename, charge, and multiplicity (the first three in the command above). Note that this command will run both MM and QMMM. By default, the calculations will proceed in the order MM min > MM heat > MM NPT > QMMM min > QMMM heat > QMMM NVT. Any of these can be skipped by setting the number of steps to 0 ( -m, -n, -l, -o, -s). If you computer does not use srun, please remove the ``-r`` in the above command. Currently only TeraChem is supported for the QMMM step.

.. note::
   The ``-r`` option should be used only if you run AutoSolvate on a computer cluster with the `Slurm Workload Manager <https://slurm.schedmd.com/>`_. In that case, the command ``srun`` will be prepended to all commands to run MD simulation.

   If you use a desktop or laptop, it is highly likely that you don't have Slurm Workload Manaer, and you don't need the ``-r`` option.

   If you use AutoSolvate on a computer cluster with other type of Workload managers like `SGE, Torque <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TORQUE>`_, or `PBS <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Batch_System>`_, the ``-r`` option won't work either.

   For more explanations about the ``-r`` option, please see :ref:`this warning message <roption>`.

If AutoSolvate is running successfully, the following messages will be printed to your screen::

Once everything has finished, the main output is the QM/MM trajectory ``water_solvated-qmmmnvt.netcdf``. When you have this file, you can move on to the next step!

.. warning::

   Longer MM and QM/MM steps are necessary to reach equilibration, and the default settings are more appropriate than what is used here for a production run.

.. warning::

    Some simulation parameters cannot be currently set by the user, for example: 

        * simulation time step
        * integrator type
        * nonbonded cutoff
        * thermostat type
        * Langevin collision frequency
        * barostat type
        * pressure relaxation time
        * frequency of trajectory writing

When you are ready to do a production run and want to use all of these defaults, you can use the dry run option to generate the input files without running them to make sure that everything looks right: 

``autosolvate mdrun -f water_solvated -q 0 -u 1 -d``
  
If AutoSolvate is running successfully, the following messages will be printed to your screen::

Inside ``runMM.sh`` and ``runQMMMM.sh``, you will find the commands to run each step of MM and QMMM, respectively. These commands can be copied and pasted into the command line to be run one at a time or can all be pasted into a separate submit script to get the jobs queued on a compute node.

.. _roption:

.. warning::

   Especially in this step, it is important to know where your job is running!

   * If you run the autosolvate commands from the command line on a system using srun, you have to include ``-r``. Otherwise AutoSolvate will run *on the head node without entering a queue* and not using ``srun``. The administrator will likely cancel your job if you are using HPC resources.
   * If you run AutoSolvate on a system without srun, don't include ``-r`` in the MD Simulation step, otherwise your job will fail with ``srun: not found``. 
   * If you use the -r flag, AutoSolvate will run the MD simulations *on the compute node*.
   * If you do not use the -r flag, but call the autosolvate command in your own submit script, AutoSolvate will run *on a compute node in the queue* with whatever settings you designate. If you are running QMMM, this is also where you will load Terachem for the QM part.
   

Step 3: Microsolvated cluster extraction
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The last step is extracting a cluster from the previous results that can be used for microsolvation. In the QMMM above, the solute is treated with QM and the explicit solvent molecules are treated with MM. In this step, a cluster will be extracted from the QMMM box so that the cluster can be treated with QM. The explicitly solvated cluster will be surrounded by implicit solvent, and we refer to the implicit + explicit combination as microsolvation.

To extract the cluster from the final QMMM results, use the following command:

``autosolvate clustergen -f water_solvated.prmtop -t water_solvated-qmmmnvt.netcdf``

.. note::

  If you were not able to run the QMMM simulation above, you can download the QM/MM trajectory here:

  :download:`water_solvated-qmmmnvt.netcdf <_data/water_solvated-qmmmnvt.netcdf>`

The .prmtop and .netcdf filenames are required, but Autosolvate will use the default values of 0 for the starting frame, 100 for the extraction interval, and a cutout size of 4 Å.

If AutoSolvate is running successfully, the following messages will be printed to your screen::

    AutoSolvate is starting in command line mode!
    Running the module to extract solvated cluster (sphere) from MD trajectories of solvent box.
    ['-f', 'water_solvated.prmtop', '-t', 'water_solvated-qmmmnvt.netcdf']
    Filename: water_solvated.prmtop
    Trajectory name: water_solvated-qmmmnvt.netcdf
    Loading trajectory
    selecting center solute
    extracting from frames: [0]
    calculating distance to all solvent molecules
    select solvent molecules
    for first frame selected 26 solvent molecules
    saving xyz

The output of this command will be the cartesian coordinates of the microsolvated clusters in ``water_solvated-cutoutn-*.xyz``, with * showing the frame number. When you open one of cut out files, the microsolvated cluster should look like this:

.. image:: _images/tutorial4_3.jpg
   :width: 400

Running the above command only generates one xyz file because we only did 100 steps of the QMMM NVT in our example mdrun, and we asked for a cluster from every hundred frames. However, if we extract every 10 steps (with option `-i 10`), then we will get 10 coordinate files. We can increase the solvent shell size to 6 Å with `-s 6`. 

``autosolvate clustergen -f water_solvated.prmtop -t water_solvated-qmmmnvt.netcdf -a 0 -i 10 -s 6``

As Autosolvate is running, you will notice this line now includes the list of the 10 frames that the clusters will be extracted from::

  extracting from frames: [0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90]

If you want spherical solvent shells instead of the default aspherical solvent shells add ``-p`` to the end of the previous command. Then the solvent shell size is measured from the center of mass of the solute.

.. note::

  If you were not able to run the clustergen command above, you can download one of the microsolvated clusters with 6 Å solvent shell size here:

  :download:`water_solvated-cutoutn-0.xyz <_data/water_solvated-cutoutn-0.xyz>`


.. warning::

   The naming of the microsolvated clusters is based on the name of the .prmtop file, not the trajectory file, so the names will not change between runs. This means that if you run the clustergen command twice, *the new coordinates will overwrite the old ones* (if the frame number is the same). Therefore, if you want to extract clusters from multiple MD steps (like QMMM heat and QMMM NVT), you need to either move or rename the files before you run the command again.

Example 2: Naphthalene Radical in Chloroform
----------------------------------------------------------

Now that we have gone through the details of one example, the second example will be the compact version of a production run.

``autosolvate boxgen -m naphthalene_radical.xyz -s chloroform -c 1 -u 2 -g "resp" -o nap_radical_chcl3``
  * must designate charge and multiplicity for the radical system
  * must use resp for open-shell system
``autosolvate mdrun -f nap_radical_chcl3 -q 1 -u 2 -d``
  * must designate charge and multiplicity for the radical system
  * make sure to track the output filename from boxgen as the input filename
  * copy the contents of runMM.sh and runQMMM.sh into a submit script that calls Terachem and submits the (very long) job into a queue with sufficient time
``autosolvate clustergen -f nap_radical_chcl3.prmtop -t nap_radical_chcl3-qmmmnvt.netcdf -s 4``
  * make sure to make note of which trajectory the clusters come from

Example 3: Naphthalene in Acetonitrile (custom solvent)
----------------------------------------------------------

``autosolvate boxgen -m naphthalene_neutral.xyz -s acetonitrile -c 0 -u 1 -g "bcc" -o nap_neutral_MeCN``
  * custom solvent called the same as Amber pre-equilibrated solvent boxes
  * bcc charge method is sufficient for closed-shell system
``autosolvate mdrun -f nap_neutral_MeCN -q 0 -u 1 -l 0 -o 0 -s 0 -d``
  * example with only MM steps in the MDrun
``autosolvate clustergen -f nap_neutral_MeCN.prmtop -t nap_neutral_MeCN-mmnpt.netcdf -a 0 -i 300 -s 4``
  * make sure the trajectory name is for the MM NPT step
  * MM NPT has 30,000 steps, so you may want to increase the interval
